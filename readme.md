# T6 HTTP Library

A library for handling HTTP requests in **Plutonium T6 (Black Ops II)** 
- **GSC script** (`_http.gsc`) to send HTTP requests from within the game
- **Python script** (`t6_http_handler.py`) to process and execute those requests on the server side

---

## Features

- **GSC Script**:
  - Sends HTTP requests (`GET` and `POST`) from the game
  - Logs requests in a format readable by the Python script
  - Automatically assigns unique IDs to each request

- **Python Script**:
  - Monitors the game log for HTTP requests
  - Executes HTTP requests using the `requests` library
  - Handles duplicate requests and errors gracefully

---

## Requirements

### For the Python Script:
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (`pip install requests`)

---

## Installation

- **GSC Script**:
   - Place `_http.gsc` in your `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts` folder

---

## Usage

### GSC Script
To send an HTTP request from the game, call the `httpRequest` function:
```php
thread httpRequest("GET", "https://example.com", "");
thread httpRequest("POST", "https://example.com", "param1=value1&param2=value2");
```

---

### Python Script

Run the Python script to process requests:
```bash
python t6_http_handler.py
```

---

## How It Works
- ### The GSC script logs HTTP requests in the following format:
```jsx
[T6HTTPREQ<ID>]: {"ID":"T6HTTPREQ<ID>","method":"<METHOD>","url":"<URL>","data":"<DATA>","debug":true} 
```
- ### Example:
```jsx
[T6HTTPREQ512]: {"ID":"T6HTTPREQ512","method":"GET","url":"https://example.com","data":"","debug":true} 
```
-  The Python script monitors the log for these entries, parses them, and executes the HTTP requests
-  The Python script ensures each request is processed only once by tracking unique request IDs
  
---

## Example
### GSC Script
```php
init()
{
    thread httpRequest("GET", "http://ip-api.com/json/24.48.0.1", "", true); // Example request
    /* 
    * [ Response ]:
    *   "{\
    *       "status\":\"success\",\
    *       "country\":\"Canada\",\
    *       "countryCode\":\"CA\",\
    *       "region\":\"QC\",\
    *       "regionName\":\"Quebec\",\
    *       "city\":\"Montreal\",\
    *       "zip\":\"H1K\",\
    *       "lat\":45.6085,\
    *       "lon\":-73.5493,\
    *       "timezone\":\"America/Toronto\",\
    *       "isp\":\"Le Groupe Videotron Ltee\",\
    *       "org\":\"Videotron Ltee\",\
    *       "as\":\"AS5769 Videotron Ltee\",\
    *       "query\":\"24.48.0.1\"
    *   }"
    */
}
```
